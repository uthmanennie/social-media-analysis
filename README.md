# Social Media Analysis Using Tableau

 This analysis shows social media's tremendous influence on contemporary communication and
 highlights its central place in the lives of billions of people around the world. The use of Social
 Media Analytics (SMA) is a strategic method for navigating the enormous amounts of data
 generated every day, with an emphasis on a variety of fields such as business, crisis management,
 and political communication.
 
 The results highlight the important role that health authorities play in social media,
 highlighting their presence there and their considerable impact over the public dialogue. It is
 obvious that health authorities use social media to accomplish a variety of goals, from disease
 prevention to mental health support, with a focus on public education and awareness. Evaluation
 of these programs' performance heavily relies on engagement, awareness measurements, and
 signs of behavior change. It is further illustrated how social media analytics and Tableau may
 help health authorities make data-driven decisions by visualizing the prevalence of social media
 platforms, with Facebook being the most common platform for website visitors.
